# Catacombs Dungeon Generator

A dungeon generator for the game Catacombs. Currently only includes content from the base game. It still requires the physical copy to play, no information about game cards is available within the app.

It was inspired by this thread: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2315321/article/43586229#43586229.

The generator is simple. It places a starting room at the top left, and then the Catacomb Lord room at the bottom right.

It then places 2 Level 0 or Level 1 rooms next to the starting room. Then fills the rest of the layout with the remaining Level 0, Level 1, Level 2, and Special Rooms.

Each completed Battle room provides a key. Level 2 rooms provide two keys (except in Impossible difficulty).

Each shop costs 1 key to enter, and the Catacomb Lord costs either 1 (Easy), 2 (Medium/Hard), or 3 (Impossible) depending on the difficulty. 

As there are only 4 special rooms in the base game, Izchak the Merchant appears twice. I recommend playing with a variant where he only shows 4x items, and the cost to show an additional item increments by 1 each time a new item is shown, e.g. the first new one cost 1g, then 2g, etc.

The room setup is as follows: 
-Easy: 3x Level 0, 6x Level 1, 1x Level 2, 5x Special, 1x Catacomb Lord
-Medium: 2x Level 0, 6x Level 1, 2x Level 2, 5x Special, 1x Catacomb Lord
-Hard: 7x Level 1, 3x Level 2, 5x Special, 1x Catacomb Lord
-Impossible: 6x Level 1, 4x Level 2, 5x Special, 1x Catacomb Lord.

On medium the runs are balanced to provide the following base runs:
- 1x Level 0, 3x Level 1, 2x Special
- 1x Level 0, 3x Level 1, 1x Level 2, 3x Special

The players can then unlock 1-2 Special rooms per additional Battle room.
